Welcome to GhettoNet!
======================


Introduction
------------

GhettoNet helps you see censored websites by adding their names to a file on
your computer.

This initial version of GhettoNet is a "command line app".  That means that
it must be run from a prompt, as a privileged user.  If you don't know what
that means then you need more help - I can't explain everything here, but I
hope that other people will, so please search on the internet for advaice.

To see all the options available, run ghettonet.py without any arguments.

Requires Python 2.4 or later.


File Format
-----------

GhettoNet data can be embedded in files a variety of formats.  A valid data
block is detected by:
o  splitting into lines based on (optional) carriage return and newline.
o  looking for the begin line
o  reading all data lines until the (optional) end line or bad data


More than one data block may be present in a file.  The encoding is assumed to
be whatever Python detects as the "system" encoding, unless otherwise
specified.


A valid data line is one of:
o  a comment, prefixed by #
o  a blank line
o  a date (simplified ISO 8601: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) prefixed by ## DATE
o  a valid IPv4 line (only, currently) for a hosts file 
Any other data are taken to indicate the end of the block (if these don't
match the end line then a warning is given; if we are parsing hosts then
we refuse to continue).


The aim above is to define something that is easy for people to generate and
send, and which can be stored directly in the hosts file, but which has a 
low probability of causing errors.

The date indicates when the information was known and is used to prioritise
conflicting entries, if present (most recent date wins).


Here is a complete example of a GhettoNet file:

  ### BEGIN GHETTONET

  # wikileaks.ch from DNS
  ## DATE 2010-12-4
  213.251.145.96    www.wikileaks.org wikileaks.org

  ### END GHETTONET

Note that indentation and blank lines are optional, as are the comment and 
date.

The most important part of this program is the file format.  Please write new
clients or design new ways of spreading this data - this is very much a proof
of concept (and, I hope, a librray others can build on).
